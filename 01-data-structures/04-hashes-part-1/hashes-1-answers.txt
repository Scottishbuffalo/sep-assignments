Doubling the size of your underlying array would be a potentially poor idea because
it would be very inefficient. The addition of one new item to the array
would potentially cause a vary large increase in the array size very quickly.
Two new additions could theoretically increase the size of the array exponentially for no reason.
This would cause unneeded delays as the array would need to be searched in
order for every time the data is accessed and every time the data is re-arranged
or re-indexed causing further delay.
